# ECE446FinalProject
University of Rochester, ECE446 Digital Signal Processing final project.  

This repository shows the course project of ECE446 Digital Signal Processing in University of Rochester, including my proposal, slides and final report.  

I mainly reviewed two papers as shown below: 
[1] Angelova, Donka , and L. Mihaylova . "Contour segmentation in 2D ultrasound medical
images with particle filtering." Machine Vision & Applications 22.3(2011):551-561.  
[2] Erdil, Ertunc, et al. "MCMC Shape Sampling for Image Segmentation with Nonparametric
Shape Priors." Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition 2016.  
for the second paper, the code I use is https://github.com/eerdil/cvpr16.

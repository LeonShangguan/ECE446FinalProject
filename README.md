# ECE446FinalProject
University of Rochester, ECE446 Digital Signal Processing final project.  

This repository shows my final project of the course ECE446 Digital Signal Processing in University of Rochester.  
I mainly reviewed two papers as shown below, 

[1] Angelova, Donka , and L. Mihaylova . "Contour segmentation in 2D ultrasound medical
images with particle filtering." Machine Vision & Applications 22.3(2011):551-561.  
[2] Erdil, Ertunc, et al. "MCMC Shape Sampling for Image Segmentation with Nonparametric
Shape Priors." Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition 2016.

for the second paper, the code I use is https://github.com/eerdil/cvpr16.
